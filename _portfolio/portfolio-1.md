excerpt: "<p>The objectives of transportation in a smart campus are to ensure safety, increase efficiency, and promote sustainability. Our current project focuses on improving parking by implementing a parking monitoring system at CSUSB that utilizes computer vision and IoT technologies to provide real-time information on available parking spots. A pilot of this system was successfully launched at the Parking Structure East in 2019, and led to the development of fully monitored parking lots in 2024.</p><img src='/images/500x300.png'>"
