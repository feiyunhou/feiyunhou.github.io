title: "Smart Campus Parking"
excerpt: "<p>The objectives of transportation in a smart campus are to ensure safety, increase efficiency, and promote sustainability. Our current project focuses on improving parking by implementing a parking monitoring system at CSUSB that utilizes computer vision and IoT technologies to provide real-time information on available parking spots. A pilot of this system was successfully launched at the Parking Structure East in 2019, and led to the development of fully monitored parking lots in 2024.</p><img src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/UV80nKN91ps'>"

The objectives of transportation in a smart campus are to ensure safety, increase efficiency, and promote sustainability. Our current project focuses on improving parking by implementing a parking monitoring system at CSUSB that utilizes computer vision and IoT technologies to provide real-time information on available parking spots. A pilot of this system was successfully launched at the Parking Structure East in 2019, and led to the development of [fully monitored parking lots](https://www.csusb.edu/parking) in 2024.
