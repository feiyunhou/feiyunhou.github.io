title: "Cooperative Vehicle and Intersection Control"
excerpt: "<p>Recent advances in TCPS will create a widely connected network that can be accessed by vehicles, transportation infrastructure, handhold smart devices, among others. This in turn will allow for control actions to be exerted on both the infrastructure and the vehicle sides. Our research focuses on the potential for Cooperative Vehicle and Intersection Control (CVIC) to improve sustainability in transportation systems. Our proposal involves joint decision-making for traffic light timing and vehicle speed control, with the aim of reducing energy consumption.</p><img src='/images/Autonomous Intersection.png'>"

This video explains our vision for future traffic intersections.

Recent advances in TCPS will create a widely connected network that can be accessed by vehicles, transportation infrastructure, handhold smart devices, among others. This in turn will allow for control actions to be exerted on both the infrastructure and the vehicle sides. Our research focuses on the potential for Cooperative Vehicle and Intersection Control (CVIC) to improve sustainability in transportation systems. Our proposal involves joint decision-making for traffic light timing and vehicle speed control, with the aim of reducing energy consumption.
