Transportation Cyber-Physical Systems requires simulation-based testing and evaluation due to the prohibitive cost of building realistic test beds. Our team has developed the Integrated Traffic-Driving-Network Simulator (ITDNS), available at [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/CTS/](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/CTS/), which comprises of three components: a commercial traffic simulator (PARAMICS), a driving simulator with a car mounted on a six degree-of-freedom motion platform, and a widely used network simulator (ns-2). 

This ITDNS was awarded for its innovation at the ICCVE 2012 conference, and a demo of our prototype can be viewed in the short video.
