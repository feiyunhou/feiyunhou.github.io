<p>My research began with a focus on intelligent transportation systems, where I explored innovations in traffic management and vehicular communication. Over time, this work expanded into the application of data science and artificial intelligence techniques to address key transportation challenges related to safety, efficiency, sustainability, and cybersecurity. In parallel, I have engaged in pedagogical research and STEM education efforts, such as leading NSF-funded scholarship programs and developing new degree pathways in data science and AI.</p>
